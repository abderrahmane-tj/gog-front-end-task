# Front-end assignment

## Installation

- `$ git clone https://Abderrahmane_TJ@bitbucket.org/Abderrahmane_TJ/gog-front-end-task.git`
- `$ cd gog-front-end-task`
- `$ yarn install` or `$ npm install` 

## Usage

- `$ yarn start` or `$ npm run start`
- Use the debug window (bottom left to update games sold so far)

## Notes

- I am using the [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) 
tool mainly in order to have a modern dev environment with minimum configuration
- State updating could use more optimization and deboucing in some places
